== Project Overview

image::nl_to_nl2.png[natural_language_to_natural_language]

This https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai[Spring AI] based project is meant to demonstrate how https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Retrieval-augmented_generation[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)] can be used to generate a JSON formatted request to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFS[GTFS] API as provided by the project https://github.com/tguless/neo4j-gtfs[neo4j-gtfs] using Natural Language.

The computer readable response from the API can then be narrated back to the user in Natural Language by leveraging OpenAI GPT-4.

The database and API used for performing retrievals rely on the project hosted at https://github.com/tguless/neo4j-gtfs[neo4j-gtfs] originally developed by @tguless in 2016 to help calculate travel plans using the open GTFS transit plan file format by leveraging a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j[Neo4j graph database].

== Example Execution Output

Initial GPT-4 Prompt:
----
Today is Wed May 01 2024 21:44:39 GMT-0400 (EDT). Given the prompt:

"I am going to leave from Westwood train station in NJ to go to point pleasant NJ after 9am on Friday"

I need to convert any relevant dates in the prompt (there may be multiple) to Javascript Date format.

To do it, give me the JS commands to execute without using variables in the format:
{
     '{datetyperequested}' : '{js command to run to set a js variable to the date value as Date object}',
     '{2nd datetyperequested}' : '{js command to run to set a js variable to the date value as Date object}'
}

Make sure to only return properly formatted json and nothing else in your response. Make sure all the required dates are included in the JSON object.

Initial GPT-4 Prompt Response:

----
{
    "departureTime": "new Date('2024-05-03T09:00:00')",
    "currentDate": "new Date('2024-05-01T21:44:39')"
}
----
---

Response processed through the Mozilla Rhino for Java JS evaluator, and subsequent GTFS compliant date formatting.

----
{
    "departureTime": "20240503",
    "currentDate": "20240501"
}

Follow up GPT-4 Prompt:
----
Given the following API
    @RequestMapping(
        value = "/planTrip",
        method = RequestMethod.POST,
        produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    @ResponseBody
    public ArrayList <ArrayList <ArrayList<Stoptime>>>  planTrip(
            @RequestBody TripPlan plan)

Where TripPlan has the following structure:

   @Data
    public class TripPlan {
        private String travelDate;
        private String origStation;
        private String origArrivalTimeLow;
        private String origArrivalTimeHigh;
        private String destStation;
        private String destArrivalTimeLow;
        private String destArrivalTimeHigh;
    }

and where where the relevant dates in the format the API expects are as follows

 {
    "departureTime": "20240503",
    "currentDate": "20240501"
}

and all the time fields must have the format '06:46:00'.

Give me the JSON payload to pass to this API to get the trip plan for the following user request:

"I am going to leave from Westwood train station in NJ to go to point pleasant NJ after 9am on Friday"?
----

Machine readable response from GPT-4 to pass to the API provided by the https://github.com/tguless/neo4j-gtfs/blob/e355ad7265efb374cec2950dbf4655f62f88fb16/complete/src/main/java/com/popameeting/gtfs/neo4j/Neo4jWebServiceController.java#L105[/plantTrip] endpoint of the neo4j-gtfs API:

----
{
    "travelDate": "20240503",
    "origStation": "Westwood",
    "origArrivalTimeLow": "09:00:00",
    "origArrivalTimeHigh": "",
    "destStation": "Point Pleasant",
    "destArrivalTimeLow": "",
    "destArrivalTimeHigh": ""
}
----

Effectively so far we have accomplished the following:

Now we can post the
